# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step1 : 
### Step 2: 
### Step 3: 
### Step 4: 

## Program:
#write a program to find the solution to a system of linear equations [6,2,3],[3,1,1],[10,3,4]

#prgram to find the inverse of the matrix for the given matrix 
#devoleped by : HOSHINI S
#registerNumber:2305003006
```python
import numpy as np
a=np.array([[6,2,3],[3,1,1],[10,3,4]])
i=np.linalg.inv(a)
print("the inverse of the matrix a is\n",i)
```
